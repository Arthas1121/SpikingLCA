## Meeting with Pete on PetaVision	
* General overview of PetaVision (Layers, columns, publishing, checkpoints, …)
* Package overview of PetaVision? (preprocessing data, simulation, analysis, plotting, …)
* Learning of dictionaries in PetaVision - how is it done (some sort of implementation of Hebbian learning rule?)

* I have the CIFAR 10 dataset and want to learn the dictionary for this - how do I start?
